# RESTful API

## Introduction

Your task is to build a RESTful Express API! You should include INDEX and CREATE for a single resource. There is no starter code for this assignment, so you should build everything from scratch.

There is nothing to stop you from copy / pasting from the classwork you have done today, but if you do **you will not learn anything** from this homework.

Instead we advise that you build out the API slowly and test as you go.

### Requirements

Use your lesson notes along with the classwork from today as a reference.

* You should have one model (of your choice)
* You should be able to perform full CRUD actions
* Include a seeds file

### Bonus

* Have a go at adding the other RESTful routes: SHOW, UPDATE and DELETE.
