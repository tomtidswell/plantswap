# Plantswap

## Overview

As a general assembly homework assignment, the task was to build a RESTful Express API which included:
* CRUD routes for a single resource
* Two different object models
* Include a seeds file

I chose to create a social plant swapping app. Users can register and login to list their available plants with a picture, and browse other plantswapper's listings. 

This was a solo assignment, and for the first version I spent a weekend working on the functionality.
